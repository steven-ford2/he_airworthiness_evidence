AUDIT CHECKLIST 4
Airworthiness Artifact
(Location: /airworthiness/...)

SECTION A — Structural Integrity (Hard Gate)
If any item fails here → artifact incomplete.
	• Verbatim criterion text included
	• Criterion reference number correct
	• Intent section present
	• Certification philosophy section present
	• Human Engineering Technical Basis section present
	• Hazard pathway section present
	• MoC table fully populated
	• Verification strategy section present
	• Cross-functional impact section present
	• Traceability section present
	• Risk section present
	• Related artifacts linked
No partial credit.

SECTION B — Criterion Discipline
Open the standard and compare.
	• Verbatim text matches exactly
	• No paraphrasing introduced
	• Intent interpretation does not contradict text
	• No requirements added beyond what is implied
	• Hazard logic is defensible from criterion wording
If you added hidden requirements → FAIL.

SECTION C — Human Engineering Technical Basis Rigor
	• Constructs clearly identified
	• Metrics operationalized (not generic)
	• Measurement limitations acknowledged
	• Environmental sensitivity discussed
	• Evidence strength classified and justified
	• No threshold invented without citation
	• Linked review article exists and supports claims
If this section reads like opinion → FAIL.

SECTION D — Hazard & Risk Logic
	• Failure mode clearly stated
	• Contributing factors system-level (not generic)
	• Severity classification justified
	• Human error mechanism grounded in theory
	• Hazard chain logically coherent
	• No speculative catastrophic claims without logic
If hazard pathway feels dramatic or vague → FAIL.

SECTION E — Method of Compliance Integrity
For each MoC row:
	• Specific evidence artifact named
	• MoC selection justified
	• Primary vs Supporting clearly marked
	• No MoC category left blank
	• “Not appropriate” justified if used
	• Evidence sufficiency discussed
	• No claim that compliance is automatic
If table looks generic → FAIL.

SECTION F — Verification Blueprint Rigor
	• Test platform clearly defined
	• Subject population defined
	• Variables clearly separated (IV vs DV)
	• Metrics align with HE section
	• Statistical approach described logically
	• No fabricated numeric criteria
	• Environmental stress inclusion discussed
	• Success criteria logically tied to criterion intent
If this section reads like a generic experiment → FAIL.

SECTION G — Cross-Functional Integration (IC3 Signal)
For each domain:
Avionics:
	• Display architecture impact described
	• Timing/refresh considerations noted (if relevant)
Software:
	• Logging/algorithmic implications discussed
	• Human-in-the-loop validation considered
Flight Test:
	• Additional sortie or scenario burden identified
	• Environmental window constraints considered
Supplier:
	• Data package requirements mentioned
	• SOW implications mentioned (if relevant)
If section lacks specificity → FAIL.

SECTION H — Traceability Integrity
	• Requirement flowdown shown
	• MoC linked to requirement
	• Verification event linked to evidence artifact
	• Traceability path internally consistent
	• No orphaned requirement logic
If traceability looks symbolic only → FAIL.

SECTION I — Certification Risk Discipline
	• Risk described concretely
	• Probability labeled
	• Severity labeled
	• Mitigation strategy actionable
	• Regulatory ambiguity identified
	• Environmental mismatch risk discussed
If risk section feels superficial → FAIL.

SECTION J — Language & Density
	• No paragraph > 10 lines
	• No motivational language
	• No adjectives without operational meaning
	• No “clearly” or “obviously”
	• No filler
	• Bullet structuring used where appropriate

SECTION K — Promotion Signal Check
This is the IC3 test.
	• Demonstrates independent structuring of compliance approach
	• Integrates across engineering domains
	• Anticipates audit challenges
	• Shows process thinking, not just technical knowledge
	• Demonstrates regulatory literacy
	• Could be presented in design review without embarrassment
If this fails, strengthen MoC, cross-functional, and traceability sections.

PASS STANDARD
Overall ≥ 90%
Sections A, E, F, H must be 100%.
No compromise.
