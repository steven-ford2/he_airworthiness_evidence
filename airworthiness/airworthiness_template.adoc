== Purpose
This index is the navigational backbone for the airworthiness layer of HE_AIRWORTHINESS_EVIDENCE.

It links:
* Criteria deconstructions (standard text and intent)
* Methods of Compliance (MoC) playbooks
* Verification blueprints (test architectures and validation plans)
* Risk register entries
* Compliance simulations (mock executions)
