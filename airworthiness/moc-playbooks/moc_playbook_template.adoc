PURPOSE
Reusable compliance logic for recurring human engineering domains.

This is NOT a criterion deconstruction.
This is reusable MoC architecture across multiple standards.

No invented thresholds.
No generic compliance claims.
Every MoC must identify concrete evidence artifacts.
////

== 0. Scope

* Domain: <e.g., Pilot Workload>
* Applicable Standards:
** MIL-HDBK-516 (list sections)
** MIL-STD-1472 (list sections)
** Other applicable guidance (if relevant)

* Operational Context:
** <fighter cockpit, high-G, NVG, etc.>

== 1. Human Engineering Construct Summary

* Primary Constructs:
** <Construct 1>
** <Construct 2>
** <Construct 3>

* Primary Risk Categories:
** Cognitive overload
** Visual misinterpretation
** Motor degradation
** Communication failure
** Other (domain specific)

== 2. Compliance Philosophy by MoC Type

=== 2.1 Inspection

* Appropriate When:
** Physical attributes are directly observable
** Deterministic design criteria exist

* Inappropriate When:
** Performance margin must be empirically demonstrated
** Human variability is dominant

* Typical Evidence:
** Engineering drawings
** Configuration audit
** Requirements matrix
** Design compliance checklist

=== 2.2 Analysis

* Appropriate When:
** Analytical models exist (timeline analysis, workload modeling)
** Data simulation is feasible

* Inappropriate When:
** Empirical validation required by hazard severity

* Typical Evidence:
** Task timeline analysis
** Queuing model output
** Monte Carlo simulation
** Statistical model validation

=== 2.3 Demonstration

* Appropriate When:
** Controlled scenario replication possible
** SME evaluation required

* Inappropriate When:
** Hazard classification requires quantitative validation

* Typical Evidence:
** Demonstration video
** SME sign-off
** Scenario evaluation checklist

=== 2.4 Test

* Appropriate When:
** Criterion involves performance margin
** Environmental stressors relevant
** Human variability affects outcome

* Typical Evidence:
** Formal test report
** Raw data archive
** Statistical analysis report
** Traceable configuration record

== 3. Evidence Architecture

| Evidence Artifact | MoC Type | Data Owner | Configuration Control Required | Audit Sensitivity

| <artifact> | <Inspection/Analysis/Demonstration/Test> | <domain owner> | <Yes/No> | <High/Medium/Low>

== 4. Environmental Stress Mapping

////
Must explicitly discuss environmental factors.
If not relevant, state why.
////

* +Gz
* Vibration
* NVG compatibility
* High noise
* Time pressure
* Fatigue
* Thermal stress

For each relevant factor:
* Impact on compliance logic
* Impact on MoC selection
* Additional evidence required

== 5. Cross-Domain Integration Dependencies

=== 5.1 Avionics
* <data timing requirements>
* <refresh constraints>
* <display architecture constraints>

=== 5.2 Software
* <logging requirements>
* <algorithm transparency>
* <failure state visibility>

=== 5.3 Flight Test
* <sortie burden>
* <instrumentation needs>
* <data integrity considerations>

=== 5.4 Supplier Oversight
* <data package expectations>
* <SOW clauses>
* <acceptance criteria>

== 6. Reusable Compliance Logic Summary

////
Summarize 5–10 rules that can be reused across criteria.
These should reflect certification philosophy.
////

* <rule>
* <rule>

== 7. Known Certification Pitfalls

* Overreliance on SME opinion
* No environmental stress inclusion
* No statistical sufficiency logic
* No traceable requirement linkage
* Incomplete MoC justification

== 8. Related Criteria
