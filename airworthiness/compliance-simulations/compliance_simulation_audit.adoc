AUDIT CHECKLIST 5
Compliance Simulation
(Location: /airworthiness/compliance-simulations/)

SECTION A — Structural Integrity (Hard Gate)
If any item fails → incomplete.
	• Scenario section present
	• Applicable criteria listed with exact references
	• Compliance strategy section present
	• Evidence package defined
	• Verification execution plan present
	• Residual risk section present
	• Authority chain section present
	• Anticipated audit challenges listed
	• Lessons for process framework included
	• Related artifacts linked
No partial credit.

SECTION B — Scenario Realism
Read the scenario cold.
	• Includes specific system/feature
	• Includes specific mission phase
	• Includes at least one environmental stressor
	• Includes specific operator type
	• Does not rely on vague “operational conditions”
	• Feels program-plausible (not fictional)
If scenario is generic → FAIL.

SECTION C — Criterion Application Integrity
For each listed criterion:
	• Exact paragraph reference provided
	• Clear explanation of why criterion applies
	• No irrelevant criteria included
	• No criteria applied without justification
If criteria selection feels forced → FAIL.

SECTION D — Compliance Strategy Rigor
For each MoC used:
	• Primary MoC clearly identified
	• Supporting MoC clearly identified
	• Justification provided
	• Why other MoCs alone are insufficient explained
	• No claim that compliance is self-evident
If MoC strategy reads generic → FAIL.

SECTION E — Evidence Package Specificity
For each listed artifact:
	• Concrete artifact name
	• Responsible party identified
	• Evidence format defined (report, dataset, etc.)
	• Role in compliance logic clear
	• Primary vs supporting evidence distinguished
If evidence list looks like buzzwords → FAIL.

SECTION F — Verification Execution Discipline
	• Test platform clearly defined
	• Subject population clearly defined
	• Scenario structure defined
	• Success criteria logically described
	• Failure condition described
	• Corrective action logic included
	• Data review process defined
If execution plan lacks failure logic → FAIL.

SECTION G — Residual Risk Maturity
	• Residual uncertainty explicitly acknowledged
	• Probability labeled
	• Severity labeled
	• Risk acceptance logic discussed
	• Environmental mismatch risk addressed
	• No zero-risk claims
If residual risk reads like an afterthought → FAIL.

SECTION H — Authority Chain Logic
	• Responsible engineer identified
	• Technical approval authority identified
	• Airworthiness authority identified
	• Review checkpoints described
	• Rework trigger conditions defined
If authority logic is missing → FAIL.

SECTION I — Anticipated Audit Challenges
	• At least 5 realistic challenges listed
	• Each challenge includes response logic
	• At least one challenge addresses environment realism
	• At least one addresses statistical sufficiency
	• At least one addresses traceability
If challenges feel superficial → FAIL.

SECTION J — Process Feedback Value
	• Lessons identified clearly
	• Framework improvement areas named
	• Template weaknesses identified
	• Actionable refinement noted
If this section adds no improvement insight → FAIL.

SECTION K — Language & Professional Tone
	• No storytelling tone
	• No motivational language
	• No dramatic hazard inflation
	• No vague terms like “robust” without definition
	• Bullet structuring used effectively

SECTION L — Promotion Signal Check
This is the IC3 filter.
	• Demonstrates systems-level thinking
	• Demonstrates cross-functional awareness
	• Demonstrates risk literacy
	• Demonstrates compliance packaging awareness
	• Anticipates authority scrutiny
	• Could be walked through in a design review meeting
If it reads like a school exercise → FAIL.

PASS STANDARD
Overall ≥ 90%
Sections A, D, E, F, H must be 100%.
No compromise.
