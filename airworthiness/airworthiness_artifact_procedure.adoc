PROCEDURE 4
Airworthiness Artifact
(Location: /airworthiness/criteria-deconstruction/ OR /airworthiness/moc-playbooks/ OR /airworthiness/verification-blueprints/ depending on week)
We are writing this for a criterion deconstruction + MoC + verification blueprint artifact, which is the standard case.
You will follow every step in order.
No skipping.

A. Setup (10–15 minutes)
	1. Navigate to /airworthiness/criteria-deconstruction/
	2. Create file: <criterion-short-name>.adoc
Example: 15-1-8-workload.adoc
	3. Paste header:

= <Criterion Title>
:doctype: article
:toc: left
:sectnums:
:revnumber: 0.1
:revdate: <YYYY-MM-DD>
:author: <Your Name>
:criterion: <Exact standard reference>
:tags: <criterion, topic, moc, verification>
	4. Copy the full airworthiness artifact structure template into the file.
Do not write content yet.

B. Criterion Deconstruction (30–60 minutes)
Step 1 — Insert Verbatim Criterion
	5. Open the official standard (MIL-HDBK-516 / MIL-STD-1472).
	6. Copy the exact paragraph text.
	7. Paste under:

== 1. Regulatory Source Deconstruction
=== 1.1 Verbatim Criterion Text
	8. Confirm:
	• No paraphrasing.
	• Exact wording.
	• Exact paragraph numbering.

Step 2 — Intent Analysis
	9. In scratchpad, answer:
	• What failure does this prevent?
	• What human limitation does it protect?
	• What hazard pathway exists if violated?
	10. Open ChatGPT and paste:
“Given this criterion text, identify the implied human limitation and potential hazard pathway. Do not invent requirements beyond the text.”
	11. Paste the verbatim criterion text.
	12. Use output only as brainstorming.
	13. Write your own 5–10 bullet points under:

=== 1.2 Intent of Criterion
No prose longer than 5 lines.

Step 3 — Certification Philosophy
	14. Ask yourself:
Is this criterion primarily:
	• Deterministic? (clear threshold)
	• Probabilistic? (risk reduction)
	• Performance margin based?
	• Human error mitigation?
	15. Write 3–6 bullets under:

=== 1.3 Certification Philosophy

C. Human Engineering Technical Basis (60–120 minutes)
This section must link to your topic review.
Step 1 — Identify HE Construct
	16. Open the relevant review article.
	17. Identify which construct applies (workload, SA, etc.).
	18. Under:

== 2. Human Engineering Technical Basis
=== 2.1 Relevant HE Constructs
List 1–3 constructs max.

Step 2 — Defensible Metrics
	19. From your review/systematic review, list:
	• Objective metrics
	• Subjective metrics
	• Performance metrics
	20. For each metric, write:
	• What it measures
	• Known limitations
	• Environmental sensitivity
Keep each metric to 4–6 bullets.

Step 3 — Evidence Strength
	21. Based on your systematic review (if available):
Classify evidence:
	• Strong
	• Moderate
	• Weak
	22. Justify classification in 3–6 bullets.
No vague wording.

D. Hazard & Operational Risk Pathway (45–90 minutes)
Step 1 — Define Failure Mode
	23. Write a single-sentence failure statement.
Example:
“Excessive cognitive workload during target acquisition may result in delayed threat detection and aircraft survivability reduction.”

Step 2 — Contributing System Factors
	24. List factors:
	• Display density
	• Automation opacity
	• Control complexity
	• Environmental stress
No more than 10 bullets.

Step 3 — Severity Classification
	25. Map to severity:
	• Catastrophic
	• Hazardous
	• Major
	• Minor
	26. Justify in 2–3 bullets.

Step 4 — Human Error Mechanism
	27. Identify:
	• Attentional tunneling
	• Task shedding
	• Motor degradation
	• Communication breakdown
Write as bullet list.

E. Method of Compliance (MoC) Table (30–60 minutes)
Step 1 — Brainstorm with ChatGPT
	28. Prompt:
“Given this criterion and these HE constructs, list possible Methods of Compliance (Inspection, Analysis, Demonstration, Test) and what evidence would support each.”
	29. Use output as brainstorming only.

Step 2 — Populate Table
Insert:

[options="header"]
|===
| MoC Type | Description | Required Evidence | Primary/Supporting

| Inspection | | |
| Analysis | | |
| Demonstration | | |
| Test | | |
|===
	30. Fill each row with:
	• Specific evidence type
	• Concrete artifact
	• Mark Primary or Supporting
If a row is not applicable, write “Not appropriate for this criterion” with reason.

F. Verification Strategy Blueprint (60–120 minutes)
Step 1 — Define Test Architecture
	31. Write:
	• Platform (sim level)
	• Subject population
	• Sample size rationale (qualitative ok if no data yet)
	• Environmental stress inclusion

Step 2 — Define Variables
	32. List IVs and DVs clearly.
	33. Ensure DVs align with HE metrics identified earlier.

Step 3 — Statistical Validation Plan
	34. Define:
	• Target effect size (if literature-based)
	• Minimum N logic
	• CI or equivalence testing approach
	• Success criteria logic
Do not invent numeric thresholds unless supported by literature.

G. Cross-Functional Integration Impact (30–60 minutes)
For each:
	• Avionics
	• Software
	• Flight test
	• Supplier oversight
	35. Write 3–6 bullets per category.
You may use ChatGPT to brainstorm but you must filter.

H. Traceability & Risk (30–60 minutes)
Step 1 — Requirement Flowdown
	36. Write:
Standard → System Req → Subsystem Req → Interface Spec
Even if placeholders.

Step 2 — Verification Mapping
	37. Write:
Req ID → MoC → Test Event → Evidence Artifact

Step 3 — Certification Risk
	38. Write:
	• Risk description
	• Probability (Low/Medium/High)
	• Severity
	• Mitigation strategy

I. Cross-Linking (10 minutes)
	39. Add:

== Related Artifacts
xref:../../topics/<topic>/review.adoc[]
xref:../../process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc[]
	40. Ensure tags include:
	• topic
	• moc
	• verification
	• standard reference
	• risk

J. Final Self-Check Before Audit
	41. Confirm:
	• Verbatim criterion text present.
	• No invented thresholds.
	• All MoC rows justified.
	• Environmental constraints discussed.
	• Risk included.
	• Cross-links working.
Stop.
