PURPOSE
Centralized register of human engineering certification risks.

Each entry must:
- Be tied to a specific criterion or domain.
- Include hazard pathway logic.
- Include mitigation strategy.
- Include regulatory ambiguity assessment.
- Include environmental mismatch risk.

No vague risks.
No generic language.

== 1. Risk Classification Definitions

Severity Categories:
* Catastrophic
* Hazardous
* Major
* Minor

Probability Categories:
* High
* Medium
* Low

Regulatory Ambiguity:
* Clear
* Moderate Interpretation Required
* High Interpretation Risk

== 3. Linked Risk Narratives

== 4. Risk Escalation Criteria

A risk must be escalated when:

* Evidence strength classified as Weak
* Environmental stress not yet tested
* Regulatory language ambiguous
* MoC justification challenged
* Human variability insufficiently addressed

== 5. Periodic Review Requirements

* Review frequency: Quarterly or before major design review
* Update when:
** New empirical data acquired
** New standard revision released
** New hazard discovered
** Verification failure occurs

== 6. Cross-Linking
