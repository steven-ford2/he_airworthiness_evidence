===Topic: Pilot Cognitive Workload Measurement in Tactical Aviation

==1. Primary Construct
Cognitive workload as it relates to pilot task demand, information processing capacity, and performance margin in high-tempo tactical aviation environments.
Not general stress.
Not fatigue.
Not SA except where explicitly tied to workload.

==2. Included Environments
• High-fidelity fixed-base simulators
• Motion simulators (if reported)
• Live-flight tactical aviation
• Mission-representative scenarios
• Time-pressured multi-task environments

==3. Excluded Environments
• Pure laboratory cognitive tasks with no aviation analogue (unless very influential)
• Commercial transport CRM-only contexts (unless measurement method relevant)
• Clinical workload (surgical, medical) unless measurement validation relevant
• Consumer UX workload research (unless applicable to fighter jet pilot vehicle interaction, or measurement relevant)

==4. Included Populations
• Military pilots
• Military trainees in aviation contexts
• Civilian pilots in high-workload simulations (if operationally relevant)
• Experienced simulator subjects performing aviation tasks
Excluded:
• Non-aviation student samples doing generic tasks
• Purely undergraduate psych samples without aviation task analog

==5. Design Decisions Influenced
This topic informs decisions about:
• Display density limits
• Task concurrency allowances
• Automation handoff logic
• Alert timing and prioritization
• Mission phase workload margin
Acceptable performance degradation thresholds
