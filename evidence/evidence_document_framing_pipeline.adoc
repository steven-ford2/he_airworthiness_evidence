MASTER DOCUMENT FRAMING PIPELINE
(For Review Articles and Systematic Reviews)

PHASE 1 — ELicit Structured Draft Generation
Purpose:
Produce a dense, evidence-driven skeleton.
Step 1: Run Elicit Workflow
For Review Articles:
	• Use Research Report workflow
	• Narrow question
	• Extract structured table fields
For Systematic Reviews:
	• Use Systematic Review workflow
	• Explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria
	• Extract structured variables

Step 2: Configure Elicit Settings Correctly
For Review Articles:
	• Require full text where possible
	• Require effect sizes
	• Require population and environment data
For Systematic Reviews:
	• Specify:
		○ Publication years
		○ Population (aviation, pilot, etc.)
		○ Exclude purely theoretical papers
		○ Include only quantitative or mixed methods

Step 3: Generate Initial Draft
Let Elicit produce:
	• Executive summary
	• Findings summary
	• Thematic breakdown
	• Evidence tables
DO NOT accept it as final.
Export draft.

PHASE 2 — ChatGPT Structural Refinement
Now bring the Elicit draft into ChatGPT.
Use structured prompts like:
“Reorganize this draft into the exact structure required by my review article template. Identify missing sections. Flag unsupported claims.”
ChatGPT’s job here:
• Restructure
• Increase density
• Identify logical gaps
• Highlight where environmental constraints are missing
• Suggest MoC implications
Not:
• Create new evidence
• Add citations
• Fabricate claims

PHASE 3 — Paragraph-Level Manual Correction (This Is Critical)
Now you:
	1. Open PDFs.
	2. Verify every statistical claim.
	3. Replace any vague wording.
	4. Insert missing nuance.
	5. Add operational framing.
	6. Add airworthiness logic.
This is where expertise builds.
Every paragraph must pass this test:
Can I defend this sentence in a design review?
If not, rewrite.

PHASE 4 — Airworthiness Integration
For Review Articles:
Add the required section:
“Airworthiness and Methods of Compliance Implications”
You may use ChatGPT to generate:
	• Candidate MoC categories
	• Cross-functional impacts
	• Risk areas
But you must manually validate alignment to standards.

PHASE 5 — Final Density Pass
You ask ChatGPT:
“Remove fluff. Increase precision. Reduce paragraph length. Ensure every claim is evidence-backed.”
Then you manually verify nothing was distorted.

How This Fits Into the Weekly Cadence
For a Review Article Week:
Day 1:
	• Elicit structured extraction + initial draft
Day 2:
	• ChatGPT restructure + gap detection
Day 3:
	• Manual paragraph correction (first half)
Day 4:
	• Manual paragraph correction (second half)
Day 5:
	• Airworthiness integration
Day 6:
	• Density + precision pass
Day 7:
	• Cross-linking + tag update
For a Systematic Review Week:
Day 1–2:
	• Elicit screening + structured extraction
Day 3:
	• Validate inclusion/exclusion manually
Day 4:
	• Elicit draft
Day 5:
	• ChatGPT restructure
Day 6:
	• Manual correction + statistical verification
Day 7:
	• Certification implications + finalize

Why This Is the Correct Blend
Elicit gives you breadth.
ChatGPT gives you structure.
Manual correction gives you credibility.
If you skip Phase 3, you become a prompt operator.
If you complete Phase 3, you become a technical authority.
