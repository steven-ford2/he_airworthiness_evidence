(Location: /evidence/journal-summaries/)

Journal Summary Time:
	• 30 min Elicit search
	• 20 min extraction
	• 30–60 min verification + structured writeup
10 min ChatGPT logic check

JOURNAL ARTICLE SUMMARY
Purpose
This artifact:
• Builds your technical depth
• Feeds review articles
• Supplies defensible evidence to airworthiness artifacts
• Strengthens statistical fluency
• Is repeatable at high frequency
This is your “reps” artifact.

MASTER CHECKLIST (Non-Negotiable)
You must complete all items before marking finished.
Selection Phase
	• Empirical primary-source article
	• Aviation-relevant OR transferable to aviation
	• Includes objective measurement
	• Reports statistical results (p-values or effect sizes)
Extraction Phase
	• Sample size (N)
	• Population type (pilot/civilian/etc.)
	• Experimental environment (sim, live, static lab)
	• Independent variables
	• Dependent variables
	• Statistical results extracted verbatim
	• Effect sizes noted
	• Limitations noted
Interpretation Phase
	• Operational implications written
	• Environmental stressors discussed
	• Certification relevance paragraph written
	• Linked to at least one topic folder
	• Linked to at least one airworthiness artifact

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE
STEP 1 – Select the Paper (30–45 min)
Search using:
• Aviation context
• Specific measurable variable
• Clear statistical analysis
Reject if:
• Pure theory
• No real N
• No statistical rigor
• Marketing-style conclusions

STEP 2 – Extract Core Metadata (20 min)
Create new file:
/evidence/journal-summaries/<topic>-<author>-<year>.adoc
Populate:

= <Paper Title>
:authors:
:year:
:journal:
:topic:
:environment:
:tags:

STEP 3 – Structured Summary (60–90 min)
Use this exact structure:

== 1. Core Question

What specific operational question is being tested?

== 2. Methodology

N =
Population =
Environment =
Hardware used =
Design type =

== 3. Variables

Independent Variables:
Dependent Variables:

== 4. Statistical Results

Exact reported statistics:
p-values:
Effect sizes:
Confidence intervals:

== 5. Operational Implications

What changes in cockpit behavior does this imply?

== 6. Environmental Constraints

Was +Gz tested?
Noise?
Vibration?
NVG?
Simulator level?

== 7. Limitations

Ecological validity:
Sample bias:
Statistical concerns:

== 8. Airworthiness Relevance

Potential affected criteria:
Likely MoC category:
Evidence strength for certification:
No prose paragraphs longer than 5 lines.
No fluff.

STEP 4 – Cross-Linking (10 min)
Add:

xref:../../airworthiness/criteria-deconstruction/15-1-8-workload.adoc[]

DAY-BY-DAY MICRO-SCHEDULE (If Done Within a Week)
If you're batching 3 summaries in one week:
Day 1
Select and read Paper 1
Extract metadata
Day 2
Write structured summary for Paper 1
Day 3
Select and read Paper 2
Day 4
Write structured summary for Paper 2
Day 5
Select and read Paper 3
Day 6
Write structured summary for Paper 3
Day 7
Review all 3
Check statistical accuracy
Add cross-links

DEFINITION OF DONE
A Journal Summary is complete when:
• All checklist boxes are checked
• Statistics are exact (no paraphrasing)
• Certification relevance section is filled
• Cross-links exist
• Tags are populated
• No editorial fluff exists

FAILURE CONDITIONS
If any of these occur, the artifact is rejected:
• You summarize without listing actual N
• You paraphrase stats without reporting values
• You omit environment description
• You fail to link to airworthiness
• You make design claims not supported by results

Time Expectation
First few: 2–3 hours each
After 10 reps: 60–90 minutes each
This becomes automatic.

Why This Matters
Over 10 weeks, if you produce:
3 summaries per week × 8 weeks = 24 high-quality evidence artifacts
That creates:
• Deep topic mastery
• Ready-to-use citations
• Statistical confidence
• Certification defensibility
This feeds everything else.
