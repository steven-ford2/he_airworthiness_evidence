# Repository Context Map

## Strategic Objective
Build a structured body of human engineering evidence that:
1. Supports airworthiness certification logic.
2. Develops IC3-level systems integration capability.
3. Connects empirical human performance research to MIL standards.

## Current Focus Areas
- Workload measurement
- Situational awareness
- Large Area Displays (LADs)
- HOTAS & control effort
- Modified Rhyme Test
- Lighting & NVG compatibility
- Anthropometrics & life support
- MBSE integration for HF traceability

## Compiler / Index
All major artifacts should be linked in a master index file for traceability.

## Output Expectation
Every artifact must:
- Be evidence grounded.
- Include explicit assumptions.
- Include design implications.
- Identify verification strategies where applicable.
