== 1. Purpose

This document indexes all MIL-STD-1472 evidence dossiers and summarizes:

* Clause coverage status
* Evidence strength classification
* MoC implications
* Known research gaps
* Certification risk concentration areas

This file must be updated every time a dossier is completed.

== 2. Coverage Dashboard

[options="header"]
|===
| Clause Cluster | Status | Evidence Class | Strength | Primary MoC | Key Risk Area | Link

| Visual Displays – Character Size & Contrast
| Complete
| A + B
| Moderate

Status values:
* Planned
* In Progress
* Complete
* Needs Revision

Evidence Class:
A – Direct empirical  
B – Indirect empirical  
C – Consensus  
D – Legacy  
E – Safety margin  

Strength:
Strong / Moderate / Weak / Unknown

== 3. Clause Map by Chapter

=== 3.2 Auditory Displays & Warnings

=== 3.3 Controls & Control-Display Integration

* <future dossier link>

=== 3.4 Anthropometry & Reach

* <future dossier link>

=== 3.5 Environmental Considerations (NVIS, Lighting, etc.)

* <future dossier link>

== 4. Cross-Construct Mapping

| HE Construct | Related Clause Clusters | Evidence Strength Overall | Certification Risk Level

| Situation Awareness | <list clause clusters> | Weak | High
| Visual Legibility | Visual Displays – Character Size & Contrast | Moderate | Medium
| Alerting | <list clause clusters> | Planned | —

Update this table when ≥2 dossiers impact the same construct.

== 5. Recurring Evidence Gaps

List recurring patterns observed across dossiers.

Example:

* Limited live-flight data
* Small N in NVG studies
* Legacy thresholds without modern replication
* Display technology mismatch (CRT-era data applied to OLED)

This section becomes promotion leverage.

== 6. Certification Risk Concentration Areas

Summarize where evidence weakness intersects with high-severity outcomes.

Example:

* NVIS legibility transitions during high-G maneuver
* Clutter-induced search failures in time-critical phases
* Color confusion under degraded lighting

This section should evolve over time.

== 7. Revision History

How You Use This File
#Every time you complete a dossier:
	1. Update Coverage Dashboard row.
	2. Add link under appropriate chapter.
	3. Update Cross-Construct Mapping (if relevant).
	4. Add new recurring gap if discovered.
	5. Update revision history.
Never delay this.
This file makes the standards folder feel like a controlled system rather than scattered documents.
