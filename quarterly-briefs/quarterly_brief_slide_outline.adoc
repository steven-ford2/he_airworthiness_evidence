Slide 1 — Objective
Title: Human Engineering Airworthiness Framework – Quarterly Update
	• Objective: Establish a structured HE airworthiness assessment process
	• Align empirical evidence with regulatory criteria
	• Improve traceability, MoC clarity, and certification risk visibility

Slide 2 — Framework Architecture
(Insert Mermaid diagram)
Key Layers:
	• Evidence
	• Regulatory
	• Compliance
	• Integration

Slide 3 — Artifacts Delivered This Quarter
	• X Review Articles
	• X Systematic Reviews
	• X Journal Summaries
	• X Criterion Deconstructions
	• X Compliance Simulations
	• Crosswalk + Framework Version X.X
Emphasize repeatability and audit discipline.

Slide 4 — Certification Impact
	• Improved MoC clarity
	• Explicit evidence strength classification
	• Environmental boundary awareness (+Gz, NVG, etc.)
	• Structured verification blueprints
	• Identified certification risk areas

Slide 5 — Alignment to Values
Safety & Quality:
	• Hazard pathway integration
	• Traceability discipline
Trust:
	• Transparent limitations & risk
Ownership:
	• Process design & governance
Innovation:
	• Integration of research synthesis with certification architecture

Slide 6 — Next Quarter Focus
	• Expand criterion coverage
	• Increase live-environment evidence integration
	• Strengthen statistical defensibility of verification thresholds
	• Incorporate expert feedback from airworthiness stakeholders
