AUDIT CHECKLIST 2
Review Article
(Location: /topics/<topic>/review.adoc)

SECTION A — Structural Integrity
	• All 10 sections present
	• Section order matches template exactly
	• MoC table populated
	• Related artifacts linked
	• Standards referenced in metadata
If structure deviates → FAIL.

SECTION B — Evidence Backbone
	• At least 8 empirical primary studies referenced
	• At least 6 verified via PDF
	• No claims traceable only to Elicit summary
	• All numeric claims verified against source
	• No fabricated thresholds
	• Contradictory findings acknowledged

SECTION C — Theoretical Precision
	• Construct defined precisely
	• Competing models acknowledged (if applicable)
	• No generic historical filler
	• No unsupported “consensus” statements

SECTION D — Measurement Rigor
For each metric discussed:
	• Measurement mechanism explained
	• Sensitivity limits discussed
	• Confounds identified
	• Environmental robustness evaluated
	• Limitations explicitly stated

SECTION E — Context Awareness
	• Simulator vs live-flight distinction explicit
	• High-stress environment discussion included
	• NVG, +Gz, noise addressed or marked absent
	• Population type clearly described
If context missing → FAIL.

SECTION F — Engineering Discipline
For each design implication:
	• Directly traceable to evidence
	• Environment-specific
	• Includes uncertainty statement
	• Avoids absolute claims
	• Does not imply compliance automatically

SECTION G — Airworthiness & MoC Section
	• Specific standards named (not generic)
	• MoC table filled in all cells
	• At least one example evidence artifact listed per MoC
	• Certification risk areas identified
	• Ambiguity in standard interpretation acknowledged
	• Linked to at least one airworthiness artifact

SECTION H — Cross-Functional Awareness
	• Avionics implications mentioned
	• Software/logging implications considered
	• Flight test implications considered
	• Supplier implications considered (if relevant)

SECTION I — Language Discipline
	• No paragraph > 10 lines
	• No motivational language
	• No filler
	• No unsupported adjectives
	• Clear bullet structuring

SECTION J — Promotion Signal Check
This is the IC3 audit layer.
	• Demonstrates independent structuring of approach
	• Demonstrates systems-level thinking
	• Identifies cross-domain integration
	• Shows risk-awareness
	• Demonstrates regulatory literacy
If this section feels weak → strengthen Airworthiness and Cross-Functional sections.

PASS STANDARD
Minimum 90% compliance overall.
100% required in Sections A, B, and G.
