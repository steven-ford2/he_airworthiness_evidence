/topics/ (Tool Mastery Layer – Goal 2)
Each topic folder contains:

review.adoc
measurement-playbook.adoc
design-implications.adoc
related-airworthiness-links.adoc
This proves:
	• Human Eng Knowledge 
HE IC2 Competencies
	• Human Eng Tools & Methods 
HE IC2 Competencies
	• Statistical Concepts 
HE IC2 Competencies
But because every topic links to airworthiness artifacts, it also supports Goal 1.
