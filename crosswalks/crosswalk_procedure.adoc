PROCEDURE 6
Crosswalk Update
(Location: /crosswalks/)
Primary file:
topic-to-criterion-mapping.adoc
This is the master integration table.

A. Setup (5 minutes)
	1. Navigate to /crosswalks/
	2. Open topic-to-criterion-mapping.adoc
	3. Confirm table exists in this format:

[options="header"]
|===
| Topic | Relevant Criteria | HE Constructs | Typical MoC | Evidence Strength | Related Artifacts
|===
If missing, recreate exactly.

B. Trigger Condition
You run this procedure whenever you:
	• Complete a new Review Article
	• Complete a new Airworthiness Artifact
	• Complete a new Systematic Review
	• Identify a new criterion connection
If you built something and did not update the crosswalk, you failed execution.

C. Step-by-Step Update Procedure
Step 1 — Identify the Topic Row (5–10 minutes)
	4. Locate existing topic row in table.
	5. If topic does not exist, add a new row.
	6. Topic name must match /topics/<topic>/ folder exactly.

Step 2 — Add or Update Criteria (10–15 minutes)
	7. List all relevant criteria connected to this topic.
		○ Use exact references (e.g., MIL-HDBK-516C §15.1.8).
	8. If new criterion discovered:
		○ Add it to the cell.
		○ Separate multiple criteria with semicolons.
	9. Confirm:
		○ Each criterion listed has a corresponding file in /airworthiness/criteria-deconstruction/
		○ If not, create placeholder file name for future build.

Step 3 — Update HE Constructs Column (5 minutes)
	10. List:
	• Workload
	• SA
	• Visual legibility
	• Motor precision
	• Communication intelligibility
	• etc.
	11. Only list constructs actually covered in the review article.
No speculative constructs.

Step 4 — Update Typical MoC Column (10 minutes)
	12. Based on Airworthiness Artifact or Simulation:
List:
	• Inspection
	• Analysis
	• Demonstration
	• Test
	13. If multiple, list primary first.
	14. If evidence insufficient, state:
	• “Test (evidence limited)”
No blank cells.

Step 5 — Evidence Strength (5–10 minutes)
	15. Based on your systematic review or review article:
Label:
	• Strong
	• Moderate
	• Weak
	16. Add parenthetical explanation if helpful:
Example:
Moderate (sim-heavy, limited live-flight)
No vague entries.

Step 6 — Related Artifacts (10 minutes)
	17. Add links:

xref:../topics/<topic>/review.adoc[]
xref:../airworthiness/criteria-deconstruction/<file>.adoc[]
xref:../airworthiness/moc-playbooks/<file>.adoc[]
xref:../evidence/systematic-reviews/<file>.adoc[]
	18. Ensure links are not broken.

D. Secondary Crosswalks (When Applicable)
If applicable, also update:
	• mil-hdbk-516-crosswalk.adoc
	• mil-std-1472-crosswalk.adoc
These should map:
Criterion → Topics → MoC → Verification Type
Only update when new connection discovered.

E. Integrity Check (5 minutes)
	19. Scan entire table:
	• No empty cells
	• No inconsistent topic naming
	• No criterion listed without artifact
	• No artifact without crosswalk entry
If any mismatch → fix immediately.

F. Time Expectation
Routine update:
10–20 minutes.
If new topic introduced:
30–45 minutes.

Why This Matters
This file demonstrates:
• Integration across artifacts
• Standards literacy
• Systems thinking
• Traceability discipline
This is subtle but powerful in promotion discussions.
When your manager opens this and sees structured mapping, it signals maturity.
