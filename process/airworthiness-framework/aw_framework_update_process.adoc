PROCEDURE 7
Process Framework Update
(Location: /process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc)
This procedure is run:
	• At the end of every week
	• After any Compliance Simulation
	• After discovering a structural weakness in templates
	• Before producing a quarterly brief
You are not rewriting the framework each week.
You are making targeted, version-controlled refinements.

A. Setup (5 minutes)
	1. Navigate to /process/
	2. Open he-airworthiness-framework.adoc
	3. Increment :revnumber: (example: 0.1 → 0.2)
	4. Update :revdate: to today
Never update content without version increment.

B. Identify Trigger for Update (10 minutes)
Before touching content, write in scratchpad:
“What did I learn this week that affects the process?”
Examples:
	• MoC decision ambiguity
	• Risk register unclear
	• Verification blueprint missing guidance
	• Traceability mapping too vague
	• Authority chain not well defined
If no learning occurred, do not force an update.

C. Categorize the Update (5 minutes)
Label the update as one of:
	1. Clarification (improving wording)
	2. Structural refinement (adding sub-step)
	3. Decision logic refinement (MoC or verification)
	4. Risk integration refinement
	5. Governance refinement
	6. Template standardization
Write this label in scratchpad.

D. Targeted Modification Procedure (20–60 minutes)
Only modify the section impacted.
If Clarification:
	5. Rewrite ambiguous bullets into operational language.
	6. Replace vague terms like “appropriate” with decision criteria.
	7. Break long paragraphs into bullets.

If Structural Refinement:
	8. Add a sub-step to the appropriate phase.
Example:
Under Phase 5 – Verification Strategy:
Add:
“5.4 Environmental Fidelity Validation”
	9. Ensure numbering stays consistent.

If Decision Logic Refinement:
	10. Update:
moc-decision-tree.adoc
	11. Ensure:
	• New branch logic clear
	• Conditions measurable
	• No circular logic
	12. Reference updated decision logic in framework.

If Risk Integration Refinement:
	13. Strengthen:
Section 11 (Certification Risk Integration)
Add:
	• Trigger thresholds
	• Risk escalation path
	• Environmental mismatch warning

If Governance Refinement:
	14. Update:
Section 12 (Governance and Review Gates)
Add:
	• Review checkpoint timing
	• Artifact readiness criteria
	• Approval signature logic

If Template Standardization:
	15. Navigate to /process/templates/
	16. Modify the specific template
	17. Ensure backward compatibility
	18. Update references inside framework

E. Integration Consistency Check (10–15 minutes)
After modification:
	19. Ask:
	• Does this change contradict any earlier section?
	• Does this introduce new ambiguity?
	• Does it require a crosswalk update?
	• Does it require template revision?
If yes, update those immediately.

F. Add Update Log Entry (5 minutes)
At bottom of framework, create or update:

== Revision History

|===
| Version | Date | Change Summary

| 0.2 | 2026-XX-XX | Clarified MoC decision logic for workload-heavy criteria.
|===
Every update must be logged.
This is promotion evidence.

G. Weekly Closure Check (5 minutes)
Before finishing, confirm:
	• Revision number incremented
	• Revision log updated
	• Crosswalk reflects changes
	• Templates consistent
	• No orphaned logic

Time Expectation
Most weeks: 15–30 minutes
Major structural week: 45–60 minutes
If you are spending 2+ hours weekly, you are over-editing.

Why This Procedure Matters
This demonstrates:
• Process ownership
• Continuous improvement
• Structured decision refinement
• Governance literacy
• Traceability discipline
This is explicit IC3 behavior.
