== 1. Executive Overview

This document defines a standardized process for:
- Interpreting Human Engineering airworthiness criteria
- Selecting Methods of Compliance (MoC)
- Designing verification strategies
- Integrating cross-functional impacts
- Managing certification risk
- Ensuring traceable requirement-to-evidence closure

The framework applies to fighter aircraft pilot-vehicle interaction domains and is structured for reuse across programs.

== 2. Scope and Applicability

=== 2.1 Applicable Standards
- MIL-HDBK-516 (Human Factors sections)
- MIL-STD-1472 (Human Engineering Design Criteria)
- Program-specific certification directives

=== 2.2 System Boundaries
- Crew stations
- Displays
- Controls
- Lighting
- Communications
- Interaction modalities

=== 2.3 Out-of-Scope
- Non-crew systems not affecting operator interaction
- Structural-only airworthiness criteria

== 3. Framework Architecture Overview

The Human Engineering Airworthiness Process consists of six phases:

1. Criterion Deconstruction
2. Human Engineering Technical Basis Identification
3. Hazard Pathway Modeling
4. MoC Selection and Justification
5. Verification Strategy Design
6. Evidence Packaging and Closure

== 4. Phase 1: Criterion Deconstruction

=== 4.1 Verbatim Standard Extraction
- Record exact criterion language.

=== 4.2 Intent Analysis
- Identify protected human limitation.
- Identify hazard pathway mitigated.

=== 4.3 Certification Philosophy Determination

== 14. Definition of Done for Criterion Closure

A criterion is considered closed when:

- Verbatim text recorded
- HE technical basis documented
- Hazard pathway defined
- MoC justified
- Verification blueprint executed
- Evidence artifact archived
- Traceability complete
- Risk documented
- Cross-functional impacts resolved

== 15. Strategic Outcome

This framework enables:

- Repeatable Human Engineering certification execution
- Cross-functional integration visibility
- Traceable, defensible compliance packages
- Scalable reuse across programs
