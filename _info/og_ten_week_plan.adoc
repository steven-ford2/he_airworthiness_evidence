Now we build the 10-week artifact production plan that feeds directly into that architecture.
This plan will:
• Hit Goal 2 (tool/topic mastery) early
• Hit Goal 1 (airworthiness process) progressively
• Feed the July 1 framework document
• Produce visible artifacts each week
• Maintain the blend rule
After this, we will build:
	1. Step-by-step instruction manuals for each artifact type
	2. A fixed weekly cadence you can execute mechanically

10-Week Artifact Production Plan
(Aligned to Frozen Architecture)
Each week produces:
	1. Topic Review (Track A anchor)
	2. Supporting Evidence Artifact (Journal summary or Systematic Review)
	3. Airworthiness Artifact (Track B anchor)
	4. Cross-link + traceability updates

Week 1 – Workload Foundations

Week 9 – Integrated HE Airworthiness Execution
Topic
Short synthesis:
/topics/integration/he-integration-synthesis.adoc
Evidence
Cross-domain workload + SA interaction literature
Airworthiness
/airworthiness/compliance-simulations/integrated-cockpit-case.adoc
This simulates multi-criterion execution.
Process Feed
	• Populate traceability model fully
	• Build complete example risk entry

Week 10 – Capstone Process Consolidation
Topic
Gap analysis document
Evidence
None new — synthesis week
Airworthiness
Finalize:
/process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc
	• Complete all placeholders
	• Insert cross-links to real artifacts
	• Add one fully populated example criterion
Executive Deliverable
Create:
/quarterly-briefs/2026-QX-capstone-summary.adoc
This is what you show your manager.

What This Produces by Week 10
You will have:
• 8+ major review articles
• 4–5 MoC playbooks
• 4–5 criteria deconstructions
• 2 compliance simulations
• A populated risk register
• A crosswalk matrix
• A finalized process framework
This is promotion-caliber density.

Why This Plan Is Strong
It progressively:
	1. Builds technical depth.
	2. Converts depth into compliance logic.
	3. Converts compliance logic into reusable process.
	4. Converts process into executive artifact.
No wasted motion.

Next Step (as agreed):
We now create extremely detailed, step-by-step instruction manuals for:
	1. Journal Article Summary
	2. Review Article
	3. Systematic Review
	4. Airworthiness Artifact
	5. Compliance Simulation
	6. Crosswalk Update
	7. Process Framework Update
Each will be written so you can execute mechanically.
Before I proceed:
Do you want those manuals written:
A) As numbered procedural checklists
B) As day-by-day micro-schedules
C) As both layered together (checklist + micro-schedule)
Choose one.
c
Good. From this point forward, you are operating a production system.
You will not “figure things out.”
You will execute a protocol.
Below is the first complete operational manual.
We will build them one at a time in this order:
	1. Journal Article Summary
	2. Review Article
	3. Systematic Review
	4. Airworthiness Artifact
	5. Compliance Simulation
	6. Crosswalk Update
	7. Process Framework Update
Each will include:
• Master checklist
• Day-by-day micro-schedule
• Definition of Done
• Failure conditions
• Output format constraints
Today we start with:
