(Non-self-promotional, professional tone)
Use this in a 1:1:

“I wanted to show you something I’ve been building that supports both of my goals for the year.
I realized that as I was studying standards and deepening topic expertise, I needed a structured way to connect human performance evidence directly to airworthiness criteria and Methods of Compliance decisions.
So I built a Human Engineering airworthiness framework that integrates evidence synthesis, criterion deconstruction, MoC logic, verification strategy design, and traceability into a repeatable process.
It’s not a documentation exercise — it’s a systems-level way to make our HE contributions more defensible and audit-ready.
My intention is for this to become a standardized foundation for how we structure HE airworthiness documentation and assessments.
I’d value your perspective on whether this aligns with how you see HE evolving on the program.”

Notice:
	• No bragging.
	• No “I built something amazing.”
	• Framed as support for goals.
	• Invites feedback.

You now have:
	• Goal-aligned self-assessment text
	• Promotion narrative
	• Executive slide structure
	• Leadership conversation script
If you want to sharpen this even more strategically, the next move would be:
→ Design a 6-month “IC3 evidence plan” so every artifact you ship maps directly to competency language.
That would turn this from good positioning into intentional promotion architecture.
Want to go there?
Yes I want to do that. But first, turn this project directly into a third formal workday goal (same format as the other two). But don’t over promise in this goal in case I fall short, because I will be rated based on how well I do. 
Good instinct.
This needs to:
	• Be meaningful
	• Reinforce your other two goals
	• Signal IC3 progression
	• But not over-promise volume or outcomes
	• And give you flexibility if workload shifts
We’ll mirror the format of your other goals:
Goal → Description (SMART) → Alignment with Values
This will position the repo as a process standardization and knowledge integration effort, not a massive production commitment.
