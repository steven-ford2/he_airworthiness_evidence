DAILY EXECUTION RULES
These rules are mandatory.
	1. Never write before evidence extraction.
	2. Never update framework mid-week.
	3. Never skip crosswalk update.
	4. Never leave audit until next week.
	5. Never carry unfinished verification into next topic week.
	6. Do not multitask topics.
One topic per week.

WEEKLY SUCCESS CONDITIONS
By Friday 5 PM:
	• Review article complete and audited.
	• Airworthiness artifact complete and audited.
	• 2+ journal summaries complete.
	• Crosswalk updated.
	• Framework revision incremented (if applicable).
	• Next topic preloaded.
If any item missing → week incomplete.

MONTHLY (Every 4 Weeks)
Instead of regular Friday journal summaries:
	• Write Quarterly Brief draft.
	• Summarize:
		○ Artifacts built
		○ Process improvements
		○ Gaps discovered
		○ Risk insights
This feeds promotion narrative.

Why This Works
This cadence:
• Front-loads evidence
• Mid-week deepens rigor
• Late-week integrates compliance
• Ends with systems thinking
• Prevents cognitive overload
It creates rhythm.
No decision fatigue.
