These two files are complete and aligned with the frozen architecture.
Now I will pause.
Would you like me to proceed with drafting the full skeleton for:
process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc
This will be the July 1 capstone process document — the promotion anchor.
Proceed?
yes

, this is the document that supports that claim.
Below is the finalized skeleton for:
process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc
No structural adjustments after this.
