HE Airworthiness Framework
A structured Human Engineering airworthiness assessment framework integrating:
	• Evidence synthesis (journal summaries, reviews, systematic reviews)
	• Regulatory criteria deconstruction
	• Methods of Compliance (MoC) selection logic
	• Verification strategy blueprints
	• Cross-functional certification integration
	• Process governance and traceability
This repository is designed as a repeatable engineering system, not a literature archive.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to develop and demonstrate a rigorous, standards-aligned Human Engineering (HE) airworthiness process applicable to operational aviation systems.
The framework integrates:
	1. Empirical evidence
	2. Human performance theory
	3. Regulatory criteria
	4. Certification philosophy
	5. Verification design
	6. Risk logic
	7. Cross-functional integration
The goal is to bridge the gap between academic human factors research and certifiable engineering artifacts.

Scope
This framework focuses on Human Engineering constructs relevant to airworthiness, including but not limited to:
	• Workload
	• Situational awareness
	• Display legibility
	• Control accessibility
	• Motor precision
	• Communication clarity
	• Environmental stress interaction
It addresses both:
	• Topic-level evidence synthesis
	• Criterion-level compliance execution
The framework is standards-aligned but program-agnostic.

Each artifact type follows a strict production procedure and audit instrument.

Artifact Types
1. Journal Article Summary
Single-study, evidence-verified technical summaries with:
	• Exact statistical extraction
	• Environmental boundary identification
	• Airworthiness relevance classification

2. Review Article
Topic-level synthesis integrating:
	• Theoretical foundations
	• Measurement methods
	• Context sensitivity
	• Engineering implications
	• Airworthiness and MoC considerations

3. Systematic Review
Protocol-driven evidence synthesis including:
	• Explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria
	• Screening accounting
	• Extraction tables
	• Thematic synthesis
	• Certification implications

4. Airworthiness Artifact
Criterion-specific compliance logic including:
	• Verbatim regulatory text
	• Intent analysis
	• HE technical basis
	• Hazard pathway mapping
	• MoC selection
	• Verification blueprint
	• Risk and traceability

5. Compliance Simulation
Worked example demonstrating:
	• Scenario realism
	• Evidence packaging
	• Authority chain logic
	• Residual risk framing
	• Anticipated audit challenges

Operating Philosophy
This framework operates on the following principles:
	• No claims without evidence
	• No thresholds without citation
	• No compliance without traceability
	• No artifact without audit
	• No integration without crosswalk update
Every artifact must pass a defined audit instrument before closure.

Certification Alignment
This framework supports:
	• Regulatory criteria interpretation
	• Methods of Compliance determination
	• Verification planning
	• Evidence sufficiency analysis
	• Risk-informed certification decision-making
It is structured to support deterministic and probabilistic certification philosophies depending on criterion intent.

Governance Model
The framework includes:
	• Version-controlled process evolution
	• Crosswalk mapping (Topic ↔ Criterion ↔ MoC ↔ Evidence)
	• Weekly execution cadence
	• Audit-based definition of done
The process document (/process/he-airworthiness-framework.adoc) evolves through controlled revision.

Intended Audience
	• Human Engineering professionals
	• Systems engineers
	• Airworthiness engineers
	• Certification authorities
	• Aviation human factors researchers

Disclaimer
This repository contains a generalized engineering framework and example artifacts.
It does not contain program-specific, proprietary, or controlled information.
All content is intended for methodological and educational purposes.

Long-Term Objective
To establish a reusable, defensible Human Engineering airworthiness methodology that:
	• Integrates evidence and certification logic
	• Demonstrates systems-level thinking
	• Supports traceable compliance decisions
Scales across aviation platforms
