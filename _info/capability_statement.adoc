Human Engineering Airworthiness Framework
IC3-Aligned Capability Statement
The HE Airworthiness Framework is a structured methodology for translating human performance evidence into defensible airworthiness compliance strategies within operational aviation systems.
This effort demonstrates progression toward IC3-level contribution by establishing a repeatable, systems-integrated Human Engineering certification process rather than producing isolated technical analyses.

Safety & Quality
This framework prioritizes safety by:
	• Deconstructing regulatory criteria to clarify intended hazard prevention logic
	• Mapping human performance constructs directly to airworthiness standards
	• Defining evidence sufficiency thresholds without inventing unsupported criteria
	• Identifying environmental boundary conditions (+Gz, NVG, workload stressors) that materially affect certification risk
	• Embedding residual risk assessment into compliance documentation
Quality is reinforced through:
	• Audit-driven artifact completion
	• Statistical verification of cited research
	• Traceability from standard → requirement → MoC → verification → evidence artifact
The result is a disciplined, safety-aligned Human Engineering process that supports rigorous certification decision-making.

Trust
The framework builds trust by:
	• Explicitly documenting assumptions and limitations
	• Distinguishing strong, moderate, and weak evidence bases
	• Identifying certification risk areas proactively
	• Anticipating audit challenges before authority review
This transparency supports credible cross-functional collaboration and strengthens confidence in Human Engineering assessments.

People Focus
The process supports People Focus by:
	• Framing human limitations explicitly in criterion intent analysis
	• Prioritizing workload, situational awareness, and usability impacts on operator safety
	• Integrating cross-functional perspectives (avionics, software, flight test, supplier oversight)
	• Promoting open, traceable documentation that enables collaborative review
The framework emphasizes protecting operators by ensuring human capabilities and limits are structurally integrated into certification logic.

Ownership
This initiative demonstrates ownership by:
	• Creating and version-controlling a standardized Human Engineering airworthiness process
	• Defining Methods of Compliance decision logic rather than relying on precedent alone
	• Developing verification blueprints aligned with operational constraints
	• Maintaining crosswalk mapping across topics, criteria, and MoC strategies
	• Continuously refining governance and traceability mechanisms
The framework shifts Human Engineering from reactive compliance support to proactive certification structuring.

Innovation
The framework demonstrates innovation by:
	• Integrating empirical research synthesis with certification architecture
	• Using compliance simulations to test process realism
	• Applying audit instruments as a definition of done
	• Structuring MoC strategy as a decision system rather than a documentation exercise
This approach advances Human Engineering toward a systems-level, risk-informed certification capability.

IC3-Level Behaviors Demonstrated
This effort reflects IC3 expectations by:
	• Independently structuring and improving engineering processes
	• Integrating regulatory and certification considerations into technical work
	• Demonstrating systems-level thinking across functional domains
	• Anticipating downstream verification and authority review requirements
	• Developing reusable frameworks that extend beyond a single project or artifact
The HE Airworthiness Framework establishes a scalable, defensible methodology for Human Engineering certification integration.

IC2 → IC3 Progression Narrative
At the IC2 level, Human Engineering contribution is typically characterized by executing defined analyses, supporting certification efforts, and applying established standards within assigned scope.
Through the development of the HE Airworthiness Framework, my contribution has evolved from task-level execution to process-level ownership and systems integration.
Shift from Execution to Structuring
IC2:
	• Applies standards and methods within defined tasks.
	• Contributes analyses to certification packages.
	• Works within existing process structures.
IC3 (demonstrated through this framework):
	• Structures a repeatable Human Engineering airworthiness process.
	• Defines decision logic for Methods of Compliance selection.
	• Establishes traceability from regulatory criterion to verification artifact.
	• Integrates cross-functional certification considerations.
	• Anticipates authority review and audit challenges.
	• Identifies and manages certification risk at the process level.
Systems-Level Integration
The framework integrates:
	• Empirical evidence synthesis
	• Regulatory interpretation
	• Verification strategy design
	• Cross-functional coordination (avionics, software, flight test)
	• Risk and governance mechanisms
This reflects IC3-level systems thinking rather than artifact-level execution.
Process Ownership
The framework includes:
	• Version-controlled governance
	• Audit-driven completion criteria
	• Crosswalk mapping across topics and criteria
	• Compliance simulation exercises to validate realism
This demonstrates ownership of process design and continuous improvement, aligning with IC3 expectations for independent structuring and broader organizational impact.

===90 second executive talking script
This is what you say in a live conversation.

“I’ve been building a structured Human Engineering airworthiness framework that moves us beyond isolated analyses and into a repeatable certification methodology.
The goal was to create a defensible process that links empirical human performance evidence directly to regulatory criteria, defines Methods of Compliance decision logic, and structures verification strategies with traceability and risk framing.
The framework includes criterion deconstruction, MoC selection logic, verification blueprints, crosswalk mapping, and compliance simulations to test execution realism.
What this does is shift Human Engineering from reactive documentation support to proactive certification structuring. It strengthens safety by embedding hazard logic and evidence sufficiency into our artifacts, increases transparency in risk and limitations, and improves cross-functional integration with avionics, software, and flight test.
From a level perspective, this reflects a move from executing within defined scope to structuring and governing a reusable certification process.”

Study of MIL-HDBK-516
	• Criterion deconstruction artifacts include verbatim text, intent analysis, certification philosophy interpretation, and hazard mapping.
	• Crosswalk mapping connects HE constructs to specific criteria sections.
	• Certification logic is documented rather than assumed.
Engagement with airworthiness experts
	• The framework is structured to facilitate informed discussions with airworthiness stakeholders by clearly defining:
		○ MoC strategy rationale
		○ Evidence sufficiency boundaries
		○ Certification risk exposure
Drafting airworthiness documentation process
	• A version-controlled process document (he-airworthiness-framework.adoc) defines:
		○ Criterion interpretation workflow
		○ MoC selection logic
		○ Verification blueprint structure
		○ Governance and traceability model
Feedback incorporation and refinement
	• Weekly revision control and compliance simulations are used to test process realism and refine decision logic.
	• Audit instruments enforce disciplined artifact completion.
This framework represents a scalable foundation for standardized Human Engineering airworthiness documentation.

Goal 2 – Gain Comprehensive Familiarity and Practical Experience with Essential Human Engineering Tools and Topics
The repository supports this goal by integrating topic mastery directly into certification architecture.
Tools & Topics Progression
	• Workload measurement → linked to certification hazard logic and MoC decisions.
	• Situational awareness → analyzed within environmental boundary constraints.
	• Interface legibility → evaluated in context of regulatory display criteria.
	• Measurement methods (objective vs subjective) → assessed for verification robustness and audit defensibility.
	• Prototyping and documentation → integrated into compliance simulation and evidence packaging.
Rather than learning tools in isolation, the framework embeds tool proficiency into operational and certification contexts, accelerating applied mastery.

This structure ties your learning and your certification goal together into one coherent narrative.
