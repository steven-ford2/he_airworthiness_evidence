HE Airworthiness Framework
A structured Human Engineering (HE) airworthiness assessment framework integrating empirical evidence, regulatory criteria, Methods of Compliance (MoC), verification strategy, and certification risk logic for operational aviation systems.
This repository implements a repeatable, audit-driven process for translating human performance research into certifiable engineering artifacts.

Objective
To develop and demonstrate a defensible Human Engineering airworthiness methodology that:
	• Aligns empirical evidence with regulatory intent
	• Formalizes MoC decision logic
	• Defines verification strategy architecture
	• Establishes traceable compliance pathways
	• Integrates cross-functional certification considerations
	• Identifies residual risk and evidence sufficiency
This framework is standards-aligned and program-agnostic.

Core Components
Evidence Layer
	• Journal article summaries (statistically verified)
	• Topic-level review articles
	• Protocol-driven systematic reviews
Regulatory Layer
	• Verbatim criterion deconstruction
	• Intent analysis
	• Certification philosophy mapping
Compliance Layer
	• MoC selection logic (Inspection, Analysis, Demonstration, Test)
	• Verification blueprint development
	• Evidence package definition
	• Residual risk framing
Integration Layer
	• Topic-to-criterion crosswalk
	• Traceability mapping
	• Governance and revision control
	• Compliance simulations (execution realism)

Process Discipline
All artifacts follow:
	• Defined production procedures
	• Independent audit instruments
	• Crosswalk integration requirements
	• Version-controlled framework evolution
No artifact is considered complete without audit pass and traceability integration.

Intended Impact
This framework demonstrates how Human Engineering can operate as:
	• A structured certification contributor
	• A systems-level integrator
	• A risk-informed engineering discipline
	• A traceable compliance authority

Disclaimer
This repository contains generalized methodology and example artifacts.
No proprietary, program-specific, or controlled information is included.
