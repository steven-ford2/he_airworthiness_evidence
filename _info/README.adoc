== Purpose

This repository documents the structured development of:

1. A comprehensive Human Engineering Airworthiness Documentation and Assessment Process.
2. Deep technical mastery of essential Human Engineering tools and topics relevant to fighter aircraft pilot-vehicle interaction.

The system is designed to:
- Integrate technical Human Engineering knowledge with airworthiness compliance.
- Standardize Methods of Compliance (MoC) selection and verification planning.
- Provide traceable, reusable artifacts aligned with MIL-HDBK-516 and MIL-STD-1472.
- Serve as a relational knowledge base for future program execution.

== Strategic Objectives Supported

=== Goal 1: Develop and Implement a Human Engineering Airworthiness Process

- Criteria deconstruction (MIL-HDBK-516 / MIL-STD-1472)
- Methods of Compliance playbooks
- Verification strategy blueprints
- Certification risk integration
- MBSE traceability hooks

=== Goal 2: Gain Comprehensive Familiarity with Essential HE Tools and Topics

- Workload measurement
- Situational awareness
- Lighting
- Modified Rhyme Test and communications
- Unclassified interfaces
- Physical interaction modalities

Each topic artifact explicitly connects technical mastery to airworthiness application.

== Design Philosophy

This repository enforces:

- Bidirectional coupling between technical HE topics and airworthiness compliance.
- Standardized artifact templates.
- Explicit MoC logic.
- Cross-functional impact identification.
- Risk-aware verification strategy design.
- Traceable requirement-to-evidence mapping.

This is not a literature collection.
It is a structured, reusable Human Engineering Airworthiness system.
